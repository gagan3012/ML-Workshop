# Intro To Machine Learning

In this workshop, we will be explaining the basics of Machine Learning and NLP and we will also be experimenting with 'straight out-of-the-box' functionalities of HuggingFace Transformers, without using any data, training, pre-training, or fine-tuning of any sorts. Finally, We will be explaining how ML Models can be deployed to a simple Web App using Streamlit. 

Prerequisites: Basics of Python and Understanding of Juypter notebooks

Techstack: Transformers, Streamlit, Beautiful Soup, Requests, PyTorch and Tensorflow

Keywords: NLP, sentiment-analysis, Question-answering, GPT-2, HuggingFace

Time: Feb 18, 2021 05:00 PM Pacific Time (US and Canada)
