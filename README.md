# ML Workshop for NLP using HuggingFace

This workshop consists of experimenting with 'straight out-of-the-box' functionalities of HuggingFace Transformers, without using any data, training, pre-traing or fine-tuning of any sorts. It mostly represents the wide range of tasks for which Tranformers can be used and their precision in doing so.
